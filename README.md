# UWP-UniformGrid-Control
The missing UniformGrid control from WPF ported to UWP. In the Microsoft UWP examples on GitHub, see the XamlUIBasics project. They have a custom WrapPanel included in the project.  I took that code and combined it with a reverse compile of the the WPF UniformGrid control to get the code that makes up the class file UniformGrid.cs. To use UniformGrid in your project, you only need to add that one file. The rest of the stuff included here is just a simple solution to demonstrate the use of the control.
